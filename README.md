Project Overview: Weather Data Prediction for Australia
This project involves using a rainfall dataset provided by the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. The goal is to clean the dataset and apply various classification algorithms to predict rainfall outcomes. If you'd like to use the same dataset, you can download it from this link.

Objectives and Methodology
You will employ the following machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate predictive models:

Linear Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Evaluation Metrics
The models will be assessed using a combination of these metrics, as applicable:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
Log Loss
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R2-Score
Tools and Environment
You can either:

Use a Jupyter Notebook environment for this project.
